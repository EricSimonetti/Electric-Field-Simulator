This is a program made with JavaFX that simulates electric feilds. There are buttons to add point charges and an input to enter the value of the charge, which can only be integer values. There is another button to add bar charges that will also have the value currently in the input feild. You can move around either type of charge by clicking and dragging them. The slider at the bottom lets you control the number of point charges that the bar charge is estimated by. If the slider is set to 40, the bar charge will consist of 40 point charges even distributed along the bar. Positive charges will appear as red and negative charges are shown as blue. Technically the true electric feild is not shown by the program, since the strength of the field is scaled down and has a max value, so the arrows of the feild do not intersect. There is also a reset button that removes all charges.

Here's a screenshot of the GUI with a few charges added to help you visualize the program's functionality:
